# AtmosFC

<p align="center"> <img src="documentation/logo/atmos-fc_logo_black-bg.png" alt="AtmosFC Logo" /> </p> 

AtmosFC is an open-hardware quadcopter flight controller designed in KiCad. Powered by an STM32G4 MCU, it integrates high-performance sensors and peripherals, and is fully compatible with Betaflight (≥ 4.5).

##  Flashing Betaflight

AtmosFC runs **Betaflight ≥ 4.5**. You can either flash the precompiled Betaflight 4.5 firmware or build the latest from source.

### Option 1 – Using the provided firmware
1. Open **Betaflight Configurator**.  
   If you don’t have it installed, get the latest version here : [Betaflight Configurator Releases](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/latest)
3. Connect AtmosFC via USB-C.
4. If required, enter DFU mode (hold the BOOT button while plugging in USB).
5. In the Betaflight Configurator, go to **Firmware Flasher → Load firmware [Local]** and select the file `betaflight_4.5.0_ATMOSFC.hex` in `betaflight_config/`.
6. Click **Flash Firmware** and wait for the board to reboot.

### Option 2 – Building from Source

1. Clone the [Betaflight Repository](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight) and install the required toolchain. Follow the official setup guide for your OS : [Betaflight Building Docs](https://betaflight.com/docs/category/building).
2. In the Betaflight root directory, update the target list by running:
```
> make configs
```
3. Add the AtmosFC board configuration by copying the folder `betaflight_config/ATMOSFC/` into `betaflight/src/config/configs`.
4. Build the firmware for AtmosFC target.
```
> make ATMOSFC
```
5. The compiled `.hex` file will be located under `betaflight/obj/`.
Flash it using **Betaflight Configurator** (follow the steps from Option 1).

## Notes 
- The board has been **successfully tested with Betaflight 4.5**. All basic functions, including motor outputs, sensors, LEDs, were working correctly.
- **I did not test the OSD feature**, as I was flying using digital FPV goggles instead of analog video.
- There is a small **voltage drop on the VBAT measurement** (~0.2-0.3V) due to the Schottky diode used for reverse polarity protection.  
  - This can be compensated either by applying a software offset in Betaflight, or by using an alternative reverse polarity protection method, such as a MOSFET-based circuit
